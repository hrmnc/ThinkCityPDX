		<description><![CDATA[There are a few reasons you might not be able to get your Think to shift out of Park like normal: The most common one is a completely dead 12V battery.

In both these cases you won&#8217;t be able to press the gear selector lever release thumb button. &#8230; <a href="http://thinkcitypdx.com/blog/?p=772" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Can&#8217;t get your Think out of Park?

		<description><![CDATA[First a brief lesson about rotating tires: &#8220;Rotating tires&#8221; is part of the parlance of automotive speak that does not lend itself to self-explanation for the unfamiliar. First of all, just to make sure everybody is on the same page, the tire is the rubber part (but there are actually other materials inside them like &#8230; <a href="http://thinkcitypdx.com/blog/?p=711" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Notes on Think wheels and tire rotations</span></a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Linked below is a list of some common maintenance services that I often recommend for Thinks. Everything is subject to a 3% merchant fee, which is basically what it costs me to process a transaction through PayPal (and I think all the other merchant service providers are about the same).

I&#8217;m not really 100% done with this business plan and it&#8217;s begging for plenty of improvements, but the basics are there. I&#8217;ve decided that I have more to benefit by releasing it sooner, collecting feedback, and continuing to make improvements than by hiding it &#8230; <a href="http://thinkcitypdx.com/blog/?p=683" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">New Business Plan</span></a>]]></description>

Hygroscopic was a brand-new word to me when I attended automotive classes and its etymology is not clear, but it simply means that it absorbs water out of the atmosphere.

Steve Van Zandt, of E-Street Band fame, stars as a mobster who moves to Norway for witness protection.
