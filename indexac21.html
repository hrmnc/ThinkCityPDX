		<description><![CDATA[Crimping is superior to solder in high current applications.  
Re: J1772 connector.
Looking into connector on the car.
The upper two large pins are L1 and L2 AC lines.
  Same as on an electric dryer, range, or water heater.
The lower large pin in center is ground.
  If GND pin conducts over 20ma , charging shuts down for safety.
The small pin on lower left is 1khz pilot.
The small pin on lower right is proximity.

The % duty cycle of the 1 kHz signal tells the car the maximum current it can draw from the EVSE.  When you pressed the button on your Leviton, it changed its % duty cycle on pilot signal to what corresponds with 12A.  The Think sees it and draws 12A.  My Think only draws 14A max on 220V even if it sees a 30-80A pilot signal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh yes, the Pilot signal.
In the initiative &#039;Open EVSE&#039; I found good information years ago.
Here is a link:
https://code.google.com/p/open-evse/
Then click left on &#062;&#062; J1772.pdf
The wiring: My TH!NK has the plug type Lewden. USA-TH!NKs has J1772.
Excerpts from ftp_asgren plans (yahoo_group_think_ev / files):
#AC_inlet_Lewden_ J1772_wiring.pdf
https://www.dropbox.com/s/l9yvp1uj0adxl8l/AC_inlet_Lewden_%20J1772_wiring.pdf?dl=0

#AC_inlet_-A40B_USA.pdf
https://www.dropbox.com/s/e7hulj0lw355b8g/AC_inlet_-A40B_USA.pdf?dl=0

#AC_inlet_-A40_EU_blue.pdf
https://www.dropbox.com/s/1atoz1rt3guf1v6/AC_inlet_-A40_EU_blue.pdf?dl=0

#AC_charge_EU_USA.pdf
https://www.dropbox.com/s/lmoo5xn57kp8spg/AC_charge_EU_USA.pdf?dl=0

You see, Lewden plug has 6 pins connected, J1772 just 5. 
Why? -- Proximity in Lewden with permanent magnet. In car-plug sits a reed contact. In J1772 works an micro switch.

Here in the EU Think had been delivered with charger cable and ICCB of Kitron / Billingstad-Norway. ICCB Pilot selection 10 or 16A.
But real maximum my device is 13,4A.
On the grid side is an Schuko connector (Old poor construction).
The allowed according to the rules of the art (VDE, IEC, ...) in the long run only 13A(25grdC). 
Merci        ..... HANS]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The two signals you are wondering about is the J1772 pilot signal (CP) to tell the car how much amp it can draw and tell the charger that a car is connected and ready to charge. https://code.google.com/p/open-evse/wiki/J1772Basics

Tje other line is a proximity switch (a magnetic sensor in the think) to tell the vehicle to stop charging if someone start pulling out the contact.]]></description>
