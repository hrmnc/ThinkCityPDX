		<description><![CDATA[Wire harnesses, specifically their splices is a great field. Loose connections, effects of back voltage and something are hard to find.
I also had time. 12V-Battery charge of the Ford Tourneo.
The generator is controlled by PWM control lines from the computer, I learned this.
In lateral protective hose was an interruption.
That may have been cracked in manufacturing, transportation or installation, I think.
Produce cable connections properly because you never stop learning.
Handling by professionals = ? (cost)
Solder connections in cars = problematically (not elastic)
Wire connections = crimp (do not solder, right tools, 7-wire lead)
Reality teaches me constantly.

I mean, the producers of the think have made effort and delivered a useful result.
