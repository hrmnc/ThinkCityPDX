Also possible / and better performance:

Important! Maintenance-free, no water refill. What both types have. Because the battery is difficult to achieve at Think.

		<description><![CDATA[BCI group size 26RMF

At Hawthorne Auto Clinic we source these batteries from WorldPac, and the brand is World Source.
BCI stands for Battery Council International.  They specify physical dimensions for the various group sizes.
So BCI group 26 has a certain length x width x height with lead posts of a certain dimension on top (as opposed to side terminals).  (Unfortunately the dimensions are not so uniform as to make the batteries exactly the same, so the way that the negative terminal clamp attaches to the post off the aft side of the bracket for the Varta battery doesn&#039;t quite work for other batteries, but it&#039;s not that big of a deal.)
The R, as I understand it, stands for Reversed, as in a group 26 will have the positive post on the left (I think, for example), and a 26R will have the positive post on the right.  So it is very important that you heed the R.
The M and the F... I have no idea what those mean.  If anyone can tell me, I would happily exchange my humble ignorance for a bit of knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My car came from the factory/dealer with an Interstate battery.  It&#039;s more than 3 years old at this point and I get occasional readings of 12.0 - 12.3 volts.  Seems like a good time to replace it.  I have to look for an independent mechanic, since the original Think warranty servicer is no longer participating.   Can you suggest a battery size and model?  I cannot get close enough to the battery to read the info.]]></description>
